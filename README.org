* Disclaimer
I will be on strike on all days except Wednesdays in the w/c [2025-10-13 Mon]
and [2025-10-20 Mon].

This is in a dispute between the University and College Union (UCU) with the
management of the university over a potential reconstruction of the university
and a huge cuts to staff numbers.

We are worried that it will lead to a massive decline in module choices for
students especially in their final years, more workload to staff and therefore a
decline in the quality of teaching.
[[https://uonucu.org/why-these-cuts-are-a-bad-idea/]].

These decisions to restructure and massive cuts to the workforce are a choice.
However, management does not seem to listen to any alternative financial
proposals, see [[https://uonucu.org/alternative-fininacial-strategy/]].

No member of staff takes withdrawal of their work lightly. We love to teach, we
love to explain, we love our time in lecture halls and class rooms. We know that
the effect on student's learning is dramatic - but it is our only option to
fight against the measures mentioned above. And believe me, the financial cut we
are taking to prove this point is not marginal either as we loose several weeks
worth of pay over this. We literally put our money where our mouth is.

* Meeting Details
But because we enjoy teaching and care about your experience, we would still
like to offer alternatives in form of teach outs. These will not cover any
material relevant for the exams but they will cover interesting topics of
mathematics.

I would like to invite everyone who is interested to join me

- When? Tuesday, 14/10/2025, between 10:00 and 12:00 as well as
        Tuesday, 21/10/2025, between 10:00 and 12:00

  If you can see my yellow bicycle parked, then I won't be far.

- What will this be about?

  1. Session on 14/10/2025:

     I would like to take you on a journey about *Chaos and Chaotic Dynamics*.
     What is it? Where can we find it? What do fractals have to do with it? How
     can you experiment yourself with it?

     If you bring your laptop, then we might look at some python code.

  2. Session on 21/10/2025:

     We will investigate Christian Huygen's invention of a so-called *isochronous pendulum*.

     We start with a few simple numerical experiments setting the scene. The we
     will explore potential options and finally we will look at what the
     solution looks like - the *Cycloid Pendulum*.
